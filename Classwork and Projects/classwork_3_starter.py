# Name : Alice Smith ( your name here !)

# Part 1: Doubling the allowance . Starting from a penny per day , calculate
# how much allowance you ’d make on any given day , where the user is prompted
# for the day. Day 1: $0 .01 , Day 2: $0 .02 , Day 3: $0 .04 , Day 4: $0 .08 , etc .

start = 0.01

# prompt the user for a number to represent a day
day = ??

# calculate the total with a loop
for ???:
    ???

# Part 2: Tip Calculator . Write code which prompts the user for a sub - total
# and tip percentage , then display the final bill .
# Extra credit : handle both situations where the tip might be greater or less than
# one. For example , 10% could be 10.0 or 0.10.
# Remember to use the correct data type .

subtotal = ???
tip = ???
total = ?
print (" Grand total :", total )

# Part 3: Fibonacci calculator . The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1 , and
# continues by adding the prior two digits . 0 and 1 become 1; 1 and 1 become 2; etc.
# The first few numbers in the sequence are: 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89.
# Write code to primpt the user for a number , and print the Fibonacci number at
# that position in the sequence .

    num1 = num2
    num2 = temp

print ("The number at position ", count , " is", num2 )

# Part 4: Prime numbers . As the user for a number and test that it ’s a prime
# number . Do this by checking if the user ’s number is divisible by any of the
# numbers between 2 and the user ’s number minus one. As a shortcut , you may check
# numbers between 2 and the square root if the user ’s number .

# Update ‘is_prime ‘ appropriately .
# Exit early if isn ’t not prime .
